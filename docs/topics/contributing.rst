Contributing
============

We love having contributors for Firefox Marketplace! To contribute to the
Marketplace:

* Find a bug to work on. This is a list of bugs we think are `good for contributors <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?resolution=---&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=good%20first%20bug&product=Marketplace>`_, but you are certainly welcome to work on `any Marketplace bug <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=11080373&query_based_on=mkt-contribute&query_format=advanced&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Marketplace&known_name=mkt-contribute>`_.

* Assign the bug to yourself.

* Set up your environment.
 * Is your bug something on the frontend (such as the consumer-facing Marketplace)?
   Then set up the :ref:`frontend`.
 * Is your bug something on the backend or payments?
   Then set up the :ref:`backend`.

* Work on your bug. Feel free to reach out to over Marketplace developers on `IRC in the #marketplace channel <https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC>`_, `mailing lists <https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-marketplace>`_, or on the bug itself.
 * Write unit tests if appropriate.
 * For code changes, ensure that you follow the `Mozilla WebDev style guide <http://mozweb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
 * For visual changes, ensure that you follow the `Maketplace Design style guide <http://marketplaceux.github.io/marketplace-style-guides/>`_.

* Submit a pull request.

* A reviewer will review your code and either give an approval (shown as **r+**) or not. Follow up on any comments and improve the pull request. When approved, the reviewer will merge.

* Update the bug, pasting the URL of the commit into the bug, setting the milestone to the closest date in the future and close the bug.

That's it, thanks!
