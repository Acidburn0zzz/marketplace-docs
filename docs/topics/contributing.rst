Contributing
============

Contributors are more than welcome to the Firefox Marketplace. To contribute to
the Marketplace:

* Find a bug to work on. This is a list of bugs we think are `good for contributors <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=run&namedcmd=mkt-contribute&sharer_id=177149&list_id=11080367>`_, but you are certainly welcome to work on `any Marketplace bug <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=11080373&query_based_on=mkt-contribute&query_format=advanced&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Marketplace&known_name=mkt-contribute>`_.

* Assign the bug to yourself.

* Set up your environment.
 * Is your bug something on the front-end or consumer pages? Then just set up :ref:`Fireplace <consumer-setup-label>`.
 * Is your bug something on the back-end, payments or more? Then set up :ref:`Zamboni and more <backend-setup-label>`.

* Work on your bug. Feel free to reach out to over Marketplace developers on `IRC in the #marketplace channel <https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC>`_, `mailing lists <https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-marketplace>`_ or on the bug itself.
 * Ensure that you write unit tests (if appropriate).
 * For code changes, ensure that you follow the `Mozilla WebDev style guide <http://mozweb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
 * For visual changes, ensure that you follow the `Maketplace Design style guide <http://pwalm.github.io/marketplace-style-guides/index.html>`_.

* Submit a pull request.

* A reviewer will review your code and either give an approval (shown as **r+**) or not. Follow up on any comments and improve the pull request. When approved, the reviewer will merge.

* Update the bug, pasting the URL of the commit into the bug, setting the milestone to the closest date in the future and close the bug.

That's it, thank you.
